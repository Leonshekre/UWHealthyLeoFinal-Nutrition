      A Balanced Diet
    </h2>
    <p class="normal_text1">
      The chart shown on the left is a great start to a nutritious life,
      however... <br />
      This chart isnt a definitve guide to perfect health, people are vastly
      different, so this guide should be followed loosely. <br />
      Taking it slow is the first step to success!
    </p>

    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">Nutrition</h2>
    <p>
      College students around the ages of 18 usually need 2200 calories (for
      women) and 2500- 3000 calories (for men) every day. A person’s calorie
      necessities largely depend on the person’s age, build, activity level, and
      other variables, so the “average” calorie intake should be verified by a
      nutritionist or doctor if possible.
    </p>
    <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">
      The 3 musketeers of nutrients: Proteins, Carbohydrates, and Fat
    </h3>
    <p>
      Carbs and Fat shouldn’t be avoided at all, in fact half of one’s calories
      comes from Carbs alone! There are good and bad sources of fat and
      carbohydrates, and this misconception that all of them should be avoided
      is very harmful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 3 main types of carbs are sugars, fibers, and starches and these can
      either be complex or simple. Usually complex carbs are considered
      “healthier” because they usually take longer to break down as well as
      having more important nutrients for the body. Fats also have a
      misconception, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are usually
      healthy while saturated fats are unhealthy.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">Vitamins and Minerals</h3>
    <p>A critical part of one's diet that many neglect</p>
    <p>
      The 3 main vitamins are A,D, and E. <br />These vitamnis help with
      eyesight and the immune system; calcium usage; and the immune system
      respectively
    </p>
    <p>The main minerals include: Calcium, Folate, Iron, Zinc, and Magnesium</p>
    <p>
      Calcium: bone strength|Folate + zinc: growth|Iron: red blood cell
      production|Magnesium: heart health and bone strength
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, there are more than just the 3 main vitamins such as Vitmain K
      which helps with healing. Fiber may not be considered a vitamin or mineral
      but it is still an important nutrient that promotes weight loss and lowers
      sugar levels
    </p>
    <!-- sugar -->
    <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">Sugar</h3>
    <p>
      According to the Association for Health Alternatives Males should consume
      no more than 36 grams of sugar while women should consumer less than 24
      grams of sugar... yet
    </p>
    <p>
      The average sugar intake for people in the United States is an
      astonishing...
    </p>
    <h4>71 grams of sugar</h4>
    <p>That is double what is necessary to be healthy!</p>

    <img style="width:30%"class="normal_img"src="/docs/Images/rices.jpg" alt="Rice">
    <h3>Rice!</h3>
    <p>
      Rice is a good food source that can be filling and healthy if mixed with
      the right ingredients
    </p>
    <p>
      Brown rice and White rice are both abundant in carbs and calories, but
      brown rice has "good carbs"... yes those exist! White rice undergoes a
      process that strips it of its fibers, vitamins, and minerals so it isn't
      as nutritious as brown rice, although it is still an option if paired with
      the right ingredients
    </p>
    Brown rice is very nutrient rich, it contains:

    <!-- Superfoods -->
    <h2>Superfoods!</h2>
    <img style="width:15%"class="normal_img" src="/docs/Images/lentils_img.jfif" alt="Rice">
    <h4>Lentils</h4>
    <p>
      One of my favorite super foods. Lentils aren't that popular but they
      provide an incredible source of nutrients.<br />Lentils have B vitamins,
      magnesium zinc, potassium, iron, and are 25% protien! They provide so many
      benefits that I cannot recommend this enough (especially since its so
      delicious!)
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Quinoa</h4>
    <img style="width:30%"class="normal_img" src="/docs/Images/quinoa.png" alt="quinoa">
    <p>
      This superfood has even more benefits, in fact it was called the "mother
      grain" by the Inca. <br />
      Quinoa can be considered a rice substitute (mostly white rice) that
      provides incredible sources of fiber, protien, B vitamins, magnesium, and
      iron as well as being gluten-free!<br />Quinoa 15% protein while also
      being low-fat. The amount of nutrients in this food is too good to pass up
      on
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <!-- Salad -->
    <h3>Salads</h3>
    <img style="width:20%"class="normal_img" src="/docs/Images/salad2.jpg" alt="salad">
    <p>The ingredients in salads...</p>
    <ol>
      Lettuce<br />
      Lettuce can provide some nutrients, however "Iceberg" lettuce is at the
      bottom of the list when it comes to nutrients. The best alternative is
      Romaine lettuce which provides a decent amount of Vitamin A, potassium and
      calcium.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Spinach<br />
      Spinach provides a much greater assortment of nutrients including iron,
      calcium, and magnesium. The best reason to eat spinach is its antioxidant
      which is very good at managing diabetes
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Broccoli<br />Surprisingly Broccoli has as much Vitamin C as an orange! It
      has vitamins and minerals such as: calcium, iron, potassium, zinc, folate,
      vitamin A, D, and E. Just like spinach, brocolli helps with diabetes.
    </ol>
    <img style="width:30%"class="normal_img" src="/docs/Images/salad.jpg" alt="salad">
    <ol>
      Tomatoes<br />
      Although it may be considered a "fruit" it is often thought of as a
      vegetable, one that has abundant sources of Vitamin C, Potassium, and
      Folate
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Cucumbers
      <br />
      These vegetables are about 95% water so they keep one hydrate. They are
      also a good source of fiber, Vitamin K and Vitamin A
    </ol>
    <br />
